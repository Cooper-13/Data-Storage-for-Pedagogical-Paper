8 months,Phase 2,10,Searching the internet for information pertaining to each of the species. Then organizing that data into the relevant categories. ,,Collecting the information pertaining to each species ,"organizational skills, researching abilities, navigating the internet, compiling data ","communication skills, how to work as part of a team",Having EMIGRA on my resume has helped me get interviews for positions because of the research skills it provided me with. ,"Yes, this position has solidified my passions for species conservation work ",,yes,yes ,,"yes, female",female,white
Since the start!,Phase 1;Phase 2;Biosphere (Y2B2),Roughly 5-10 during phase 1 and a bit less during phase 2,Looking at migratory data/information using research papers and other useful online sources to gather information and consolidate it,,Y2B2 100%! Meeting everyone who is so passionate was amazing!,Filtering through online sources or research papers to find pertinent info much quicker.,"Communicating with people from different fields of science/biology in a way that they can better understand, writing op-eds, and communicating via social media for the general public.","Not as of yet, but I do feel that it aided me when applying for a conservation based MSc program.","100%! I started to do my BSc with Honors research in agriscience and then realized that my devotion is towards conservation as I kept recalling my experience and enjoyment being at Y2B2 throughout my work with crop plants, and now I am preparing to do my MSc in wetland conservation and restoration!",,"I would say so because I learned a lot about migratory species and how overlooked their protection is. Aside from pure conservation efforts, I learned a lot of crucial skills that I will carry with me (filtering info from papers, communicating efficiently, working with others, etc).",I would say yes because typically its MSc students who get to be involved in such large projects so getting this experience early on is very fulfilling.,Not really. Outside of meeting everyone that attended the Y2B2 meeting its hard to keep connections strong without communicating or working together frequently.,Maybe as female. I'm sure other ethnicities and those identifying with the LGBT+ have a more difficult time.,Female,White
1 year 8 months,Phase 1;Phase 2;Biosphere (Y2B2),5,"Searching for and organizing geographical, ecological, and legal information online about various species assigned to me.","Near the end of my time working with EMIGRA, I felt that I needed to focus more on some of my other responsibilities, and leaving allowed me to move on to other opportunities. I also at that point felt like I wasn't able to commit nearly as much time and energy to EMIGRA as I had been able to earlier, so me leaving hopefully opened up a space for someone more productive to join the EMIGRA team.","The Y2B2 trip was definitely the biggest highlight. It was really cool to visit Arizona and the Biosphere, participate in science communication workshops, and interact with more experienced people working in conservation. I really appreciate that the undergraduate researchers were included in this trip.","Searching databases efficiently, finding credible information sources, data entry and organization, science communication, understanding of ecosystem services and NCP framework","Time management, patience/persistence, personal goal-setting, public speaking (from one of the Y2B2 workshops)","EMIGRA was my first research experience and my first job related to ecological and conservation work, so I think having this as a prior experience helped me get other research and conservation jobs because I could talk about my time with EMIGRA to potential employers. Specifically, I've had a summer fellowship with an environmental education center/nature reserve (at The Watershed Institute, NJ) and I have an upcoming summer research internship in marine ecology (at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science), both of which I obtained with the help of having EMIGRA on my resume.","It strengthened my interest in ecological research and conservation work. It also helped me realize that I may not be well suited to remote asynchronous work, or work where I need to sit at a computer all the time.","During Phase 1, I wish there had been some opportunity to have some variation to our tasks (although I understand that may not have been possible). Repeating the same research tasks became monotonous very quickly.","Yes, I'm planning to pursue a career in conservation and/or research and EMIGRA was my first experience in conservation and research work, making it a very valuable stepping stone for me.","Yes, this kind of opportunity seems usually limited to graduate students, and so far I haven't encountered other opportunities like it available to undergrads.","Yes, I was introduced to Dr. Charles Chester through EMIGRA, who has been a great connection for me as a student at Brandeis.","LGBTQ+, second-generation immigrant",Woman,Indian (South Asia)
1 year ish,Phase 1;Phase 2,5,"mostly looking at maps for phase 1, answering the surveys. i did a little work with phase 2 and that was figuring out which people worked with the animals. lots of trawling google searches and chasing down which companies/organizations were int eh areas the species were most well known in.",it didn't work with my school schedule and also the prof at my school (msvu) moved on to another university,learning factoids about migratory species,"deep research skills, double checking results",,,,,it was good to get to do some RA work and its something i would liek to do again if the opportunity arose.,,,,genderqueer,white 
~1 year,Phase 1;Biosphere (Y2B2),"average 5 hours, sometimes a lot more or less, variable",completing species surveys,I was traveling a lot over the summer in 2023 so I was unable to work at that time. I reached out about continuing to help out when I got back but never received a response. I would've liked to continue working with EMIGRA.,The flexibility of working however much I wanted when I wanted was really helpful. I enjoyed meeting everyone in person at the Y2B2 meeting.,research skills,,I don't think my experience with EMIGRA alone got me any jobs but I believe it helped,no,communication--I would've liked to continue working with EMIGRA. I also wish we would've been able to do more with the senior researchers,Yes I believe the undergraduate work was important but I would've liked to see what was done with the research in the next stage of the project,,no,no,female,caucasian
2 years,Phase 1;Phase 2;Biosphere (Y2B2),2 hours,"Research! Mostly looking at articles and websites about the environment/species (IUCN, etc)",I just had a very overwhelming schedule and the work I had took priority because I was on a 8-month contract plus finishing my Honours degree and writing a thesis.,The Y2B2. It made me fall in love with research all over again.,"I improved my research skills tremendously. At the beginning, I was quite slow at researching species at first and I cut my research time in half. Additionally, that carried over to research on other projects and I became very efficient at it.",,,,,"Extremely. It opened up possibilities for me to grow not only as a researcher but also as a team member, especially when working on part 2 where I had to share and work along with other members","Yes, I believe we are often overlooked in research and it gave me hope I could work on the field even though I wasn't a masters/phd student",I did have an amazing relationship with Columba when working there!,"Woman, LGBTQ+, Indigenous, Latinx",Female,"Latinx/Non-white , Indigenous from South America"

Being in Canada, I found it was hard sometimes to feel connected to the project or to know who the main researchers were. Also, understanding the project as a whole as sometimes I it would hard to understand what was expected of me without understanding the whole","Yes, I think so. The research experience was invaluable in understanding what goes into a funded research project after your degree. Also, when it feels as if you're researching only small, insignificant pieces, those small pieces are just as important to the whole as anything else","Yes, I think so. Travelling to Arizona (though I wasn't a part of that group) seemed a perfect way to meet the main researchers, as being in Canada, it was easy to feel disconnected from the main body of the project ",No,No,Female,European ancestry
