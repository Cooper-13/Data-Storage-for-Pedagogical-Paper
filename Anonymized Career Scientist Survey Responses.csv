What is your role with EMIGRA?,How did/do you make use of the data collected by undergraduate students for EMIGRA?,What feedback did EMIGRA students provide to you about their experience with the project?,"What is your overall assessment of the EMIGRA student experience? To what degree is the student experience valuable, and how could it have been improved?",Describe your interactions with EMIGRA students. Please be specific.,What types of work do you foresee undergraduates doing for EMIGRA going forward?
"One of the almost original workgroup members, primarily providing policy perspectives from the US federal government (mostly USFWS), and providing data/insights on migratory bird species for the group to analyze.","I haven't used it individually, but as a group we are analyzing the data to determine whether certain aspects of governance are related to the data collected by the students (e.g., range, trend, IUCN status, etc.).",Generally that they appreciated the opportunity to do work for researchers in the field and the interactions with professionals.,"I'm not sure, since I didn't have a lot of interaction with them. This is best asked of the students themselves.","My only interactions were at the Biosphere 2 meeting a couple of years ago. At that time, we discussed with the students the overall goals of the research, so they could see how their work fit in with and was critical to its success. They also were provided opportunities to ask questions, provide input, and detail their experiences to individual group members if they so desired.","Hard to tell beyond the current tasks, because it will depend on the success in obtaining future grants to continue the research path EMIGRA is on."
"Advising Jendrik in developing paper on dynamic subidies for pintails, and participating in ""all hands"" discussions while giving input on all scientific aspects of the NSF project",I am not working with the data directly but giving input on the analysis led by Wayne and others,"One student mentioned last week that their participation in the project led to internships that they thought would otherwise would not have happened without emigra.  There may have been others, but I do not recall.",Overall positive.  Benefits for the project include receiving a larger volume of data than would be possible if relying on paid employees with bachelor degrees or higher.   Another benefit is being able to reach a broader and younger audience -- spreading knowledge about the approaches and literature related to the project.  Next time would be good to run a survey like this about once or twice per year.  ,"Among the bachelor students, I only interacted with one in a meaningful way.  This student was very engaged at the Y2B2 meeting and provided useful input to developing the conceptual modeling framework.  The same student is now starting to support my own research.","Supporting quality control checks of the data collected through the literature and interviews with actors, stakeholders, and decision-makers.   They may also support entering data collected by these interviews."
PI,"To inform the selection of species for the fellows, the questions the fellows will ask, and ultimately we will use the info along with the data fellows collect to develop governance principles","I've heard nothing but positive feedback, but I have not worked directly with the students for the majority of the project.",The student work has been essential to the progress of the project. We would not be where we are now if they had not collected the data on species to this point. ,I have not worked directly with the students on EMIGRA work much. Most of my interaction has been at team meetings. ,"I expect that we will continue to engage them in the collection and analysis of species data, especially archival data."
Research director,We are working on several papers. Our CCR Fellows are using the data as they plan and execute the their research.,"The feedback was all positive, ranging from ""very interesting work"" to ""profoundly important experience that helped me decide on career path""",Some students took advantage of the opportunities to work more closely with the EMIGRA team.  Those who didn't still appreciated being part of the overall endeavor and understood they were contributing to something worthy.,My interactions were quite limited in most cases. I had conversations with those who attended our Biosphere meeting and/or otherwise became more involved.  ,I'm open to ideas.
researcher,I haven't yet - the 928 species paper will be the first time we've used the data directly. ,I don't think I received any feedback directly.,"I think it depends on which student experience. For those who worked on the database last year, I think there was less opportunity for direct engagement with researchers. I still believe the students got a valuable experience through participation at our meeting and contribution to a research project. Given the early stage of this work, however, I don't think most really got to see how their efforts would contribute to the broader project goals. In contrast, the students engaged now seem to be more fully embedded and engaged with researchers and able to see how their work will contribute to broader project goals. I think sending them to the market with researchers was a great idea. Not sure yet how their experience could have been improved. ","Well, I have interacted with Mr. Gottfried a fair amount on an upcoming paper. Otherwise, up to this point I have only interacted socially with EMIGRA students. Several have my contact information and instructions to call me if they ever want to discuss their work.","I foresee the students (undergraduate and graduate) continuing to assist with data collection and curation, and hopefully contributing to some of the papers."
I am a member of the bat team in Mexico. I am responsible for collecting guano samples for analysis.,"I helped the CCR Fellows better understand the distribution of the species they will be working with, as well as their common names in Spanish. I also shared some of my experience working with bats in the regions where the students will be conducting interviews.",All the CCR Felows are very excited to be part of EMIGRA. They were very grateful for the support I provided.,I believe that each of the CCR fellows has sufficient experience to perform their work adequately. They handled themselves easily and asked questions that helped improve the methodology they will use for their interviews.,"My experience consisted of seeing through the eyes of the CCR Fellows the progress they have made in their interviews. Also, spending time with them and sharing academic experiences and field experiences, in the case of the CCR Fellows who will be conducting their interviews in Mexico.","All sorts of tasks, from assisting a researcher to being leaders of their own projects, that are part of EMIGRA's objectives."
Co-Principle Investigator,"No direct use yet, but data will be focus of future research","Nothing systemic that I know of; we have not set up a system to garner student feedback. Anecdotally, feedback I have received is that engaged students have had a worthwhile experience, while non-engaged students have not lasted long.   ","I believe that for students who have conducted extensive research and participated in EMIGRA activities, the student experience has been highly valuable. It could have been improved by its overseers (including myself) setting up a more systematic framework for assessment of student experience and contributions.","I am the nominal supervisor of the ""Brandeis EMIGRA Team"" (BET), but that supervision has been mostly nominal; J.Derbridge and student leaders have been the principal supervisors/contacts for the students. My contact with students has been in meetings and travel/workshop experiences.  ","Many things, but a big one would be to be involved in reviving GROMS"
